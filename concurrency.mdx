## Rate Limiting and Concurrency

While there are no rate limits on the number of requests you can make per minute, there are concurrency limits based on your subscription plan:

- Free Account: Maximum of 1 concurrent request.
- Basic Plan: Maximum of 8 concurrent requests.

To check your current concurrency limits:

- Log in to your HarvestAPI account.
- Navigate to your [Subscription Page](https://harvest-api.com/admin/subscription).
- Review your plan details to see your concurrency limits.

Exceeding your concurrency limits should usually put your next requests in a queue,
though request rejection is also possible (in case of too many requests in the queue).
Ensure that your application manages concurrent requests appropriately
to stay within your plan's limits.
