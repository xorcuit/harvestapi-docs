title: 'Rate Limiting and Concurrency'

---

While there are no rate limits on the number of requests you can make per minute, there are concurrency limits based on your subscription plan:

- Free Account: Maximum of 1 concurrent request.
- Basic Plan: Maximum of 6 concurrent requests.

To check your current concurrency limits:

- Log in to your HarvestAPI account.
- Navigate to your [Subscription Page](https://harvest-api.com/admin/subscription).
- Review your plan details to see your concurrency limits.

Exceeding your concurrency limits should put your next requests in a queue. The queue size is 10 per account.  
Exceeding the queue size will result in an error response.  
Ensure that your application manages concurrent requests appropriately to stay within your plan's limits.

## How many requests per minute?

Based on our statistics our average scraping time:

- 1.3s per company.
- 3.4s per main profile.
- 3.6s per full profile (complete profile sections).

This means, for example on Basic plan:

- 60 / 1.3 \* 6 ~ 277 requests/minute for companies on average when using maximum concurrency.
- 60 / 3.4 \* 6 ~ 106 requests/minute for main profiles on average when using maximum concurrency.
