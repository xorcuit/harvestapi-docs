title: 'Rate Limiting and Concurrency'

While there are no rate limits on the number of requests you can make per minute, there are concurrency limits based on your subscription plan:

- Free Account: Maximum of 1 concurrent request.
- Basic Plan: Maximum of 6 concurrent requests.

To check your current concurrency limits:

- Log in to your HarvestAPI account.
- Navigate to your [Subscription Page](https://harvest-api.com/admin/subscription).
- Review your plan details to see your concurrency limits.

Exceeding your concurrency limits should put your next requests in a queue. The queue size is 10 per account.  
Exceeding the queue size will result in an error response.  
Ensure that your application manages concurrent requests appropriately to stay within your plan's limits.

## How many requests per minute?

Our average scraping time for companies is 1.3s. For profiles, it's 2.6s.  
This means on Basic plan, for example:

- 60 / 1.3 \* 6 ~ 277 req/min for companies on average
- 60 / 2.6 \* 6 ~ 138 req/min for profiles on average
