For some endpoints, you might want to use your personal LinkedIn account to get better results.
For example, to get better results from the [Profile Search](/linkedin-api-reference/profile/search) endpoint.

HarvestAPI can use user-supplier LinkedIn accounts. All API endpoints support these query parameters:

- `cookie` : your LinkedIn cookie base64 encoded. You can export your cookie via the browser extension [Cookie-Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm/).
  After installing it, navigate to Sales Navigator page -> open extension popup -> click "Export" -> JSON.
  Use any base64 encoder ([for example](https://www.base64encode.org/)) to encode the JSON and pass it as the `cookie` parameter.
- `proxy` (optionally): We recommend you to find a clean residential/mobile proxy.
  Proxy location should ideally match your login location. When it's not provided, the scraper will use our proxy pool.
- `userAgent` (optionally): We also recommend to provide your User Agent, otherwise LinkedIn may log you out
  after scraping a few pages. If you keep getting logged out, copy your user agent from the same browser where
  you exported your cookie, [for example via a tool](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent/).

### Side notes on using custom accounts

- Ideally proxy external IP address shouldn't change. Use static proxies, or proxies with long sticky sessions.
- Don't forget to check IP quality of your proxy, for example `ipqualityscore.com` Proxy Detection Test
  should ideally show all green checks, [for example](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/free-ip-lookup-proxy-vpn-test/lookup/172.56.84.82)

## Example

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  search: 'Director',
  location: 'US',
  cookie: btoa('[{"domain":".linkedin.com","expirationDate":...'), // `btoa` helper to base64 encode the cookie
  proxy: 'http://user:password@example.com:8080',
  userAgent:
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
});
fetch(`https://api.harvest-api.com/linkedin/profile-search?${params.toString()}`, {
  headers: { 'X-API-Key': '<api-key>' },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
