## Basic profile search scraper

We refer to the Basic profile search as the search located at https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/.
We have the [Profile Search API endpoint](/linkedin-api-reference/profile/search) to scrape this page - it accepts search input parameters like name, location, current company, etc., and
page number for pagination. The scraper returns a list of search items (_not profiles, see below why_) matching the search criteria.

This search can usually find a limited number profiles when searching by name.  
When searching by other queries (for example, by job title), this is how the [search page looks like](/images/screenshot_2025-09-29_033012.png)
to our scrapers. Most of the search results are anonymized and displayed as `“LinkedIn Member”` without a profile link. We cannot scrape these profiles.
The scraper will return these search items, though generally they are not useful.

If you compare it to browsing [the search](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/) with your personal LinkedIn account,
you will find more exposed profile links due to your number of LinkedIn connections.
Our basic profile search scraper won't be able to extract the same number of search results.

To work this around, [you can pass you own LinkedIn account to the scraper](/guides/custom-accounts).

If you use your personal account without a premium subscription, you will hit [LinkedIn's monthly quota
for searches](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a524372/monthly-people-search-usage) pretty quickly.

## Linkedin service search scraper

LinkedIn has a separate search for people who offer services. The service search does not hide any
profiles behind "LinkedIn Member" anonymization, so it's possible to fully extract 100 pages, 10 profiles per page,
i.e. 1000 profiles per search query - which makes it a great alternative to find a good number of profiles when
searching by job title or skills. The drawback is that it can find fewer profiles.

For example "Web design" in "California": https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/services/?geoUrn=%5B%22102095887%22%5D&keywords=web%20design
can find about 3,300 results. While the the Basic profile search counts 37,867 profiles total for the same query.

To scrape the services search, please use the [Service Search API endpoint](/linkedin-api-reference/service/search).  
Or the Apify Actor [LinkedIn Services Search Scraper](https://apify.com/harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search-by-services).

## Lead search scraper

The [Lead search endpoint](/linkedin-api-reference/leads/search-leads) scrapes profiles from a different LinkedIn search
without missing profiles due to the `"LinkedIn Member"` issue
[Our Profile search Apify actor uses the same API](https://apify.com/harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search).

The Lead search scraper handles extraction of 100,000 of profiles in several hours, please contact us for large-scale scraping volumes.
