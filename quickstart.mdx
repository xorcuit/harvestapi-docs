## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the request headers.

1. **Obtain Your API Key**:

   - Log in to your HarvestAPI account.
   - Navigate to the [API keys Dashboard](https://harvestapi.net/admin/api-keys).
   - Create new API key.

2. **Include API Key in Request Headers**:

   - For each API request, include the following header:

     ```
     X-API-Key: <your-api-key>
     ```

## Making API Requests

All API requests are made to the following base URL: `https://harvestapi.net/api`

For example, company search by keyword

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://harvestapi.net/api/linkedin/company-search?search=Google \
  --header 'X-API-Key: <api-key>'
```

```javascript JavaScript
fetch(`https://harvestapi.net/api/linkedin/company-search?search=Google`, {
  headers: { 'X-API-Key': '<api-key>' },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://harvestapi.net/api/linkedin/company-search?search=Google"

headers = {"X-API-Key": "<api-key>"}

response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limiting and Concurrency

While there are no rate limits on the number of requests you can make per minute, there are concurrency limits based on your subscription plan:

- Free Account: Maximum of 1 concurrent request.
- Basic Plan: Maximum of 10 concurrent requests.

To check your current concurrency limits:

- Log in to your HarvestAPI account.
- Navigate to your [Subscription Page](https://harvestapi.net/admin/subscription).
- Review your plan details to see your concurrency limits.

Exceeding your concurrency limits should usually put your next requests in a queue,
though request rejection is also possible. Ensure that your application manages concurrent requests appropriately
to stay within your plan's limits.
