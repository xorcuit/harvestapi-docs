Send a connection request to a LinkedIn profile from your own LinkedIn account. You can use this endpoint to automate your LinkedIn outreach.

This endpoint works only with custom accounts. Please check the [Using Custom Accounts](/guides/custom-accounts) guide for more details on how to set up and use custom accounts.

Stay within LinkedIn's limits and best practices to avoid restrictions on your account. We recommend sending no more than 20 connection requests per day.
