title: 'Search Leads'
openapi: 'GET /linkedin/lead-search'
---

- This is the same search as used in [the Profile Search Apify Actor](https://apify.com/harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search)
  and in the [Company Employees Search](https://apify.com/harvestapi/linkedin-company-employees) - it's possible to replicate
  features of these actors using this API endpoint.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  page: '1',
  search: 'Machine Learning Engineer',
  currentCompany: 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/google',
  location: 'US',
  seniorityLevelIds: '120,210',
  profileLanguages: 'en',
  excludeSeniorityLevelIds: '220,300,310',
});
fetch(`https://api.harvest-api.com/linkedin/lead-search?${params.toString()}`, {
  headers: { 'X-API-Key': '<api-key>' },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

## Session ID

- LinkedIn applies search personalization, so the results may vary based on resources used for scraping.
- When iterating over multiple pages, different pages might be scraped by different resources, which can lead to inconsistent results.

To mitigate this, you can use the `sessionId` parameter to request our backend to use the same resource.  
To create a `sessionId`, you can generate a random string (e.g., using UUID) and pass it as a query parameter in your API request.  
This `sessionId` will not be passed to LinkedIn, it is used only internally in our backend to identify which requests should be processed by the same resource. Our backend tracks LinkedIn's `sessionId` independently.

In case if the initially assigned resource becomes unavailable (rate-limited, proxy offline, etc.), our backend will reassign the session to a different resource.

Using `sessionId` slows requests down, as multiple users (or even different sessions) can be acquiring the same resource. Since our resources can process only one request at a time, requests with `sessionId` will be queued until the resource is available to take a new request.
